WP Developers Facebook Comments
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that easily adds and enables Facebook comments for your WordPress site. With an options page, shortcode, and action code included, I'm a breeze to use.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the WPDev Toolkit options screen to configure the plugin.
